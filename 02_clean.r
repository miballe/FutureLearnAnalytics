# The functions inside this file transform the raw read data
# into R data frames to ensure data types are correct, NA and
# NaN values are either replaced or assigned, values are within
# expected ranges and in general the data is ready to get
# reliable and closer to reality statistics. In particular
# there are some files (older datasets) that have a smaller
# schema than the new ones, so the missing values are assigned
# either with a calculation, or simply assigning a default value.
